# IntelligentTrader

The intelligent trader takes the user input of a stock ticker and aggregates most recent financial data. It then takes this data as the features for the random forest model which then predicts a financial report score. A financial report score is a way to measure the quality of a financial report. It is created by taking the difference between a row and its previous values and then normalizing the data using a sigmoid function before it is summed to create the financial report score. This predicted output, according to our hypothesis, can further enhance the accuracy of the predicted scores using the sentiment and prices based neural network. This neural netowrk will be run on several different time frames which is then returned back to the front end. THe front end can then store these predicted prices changes along with the financail data aggregated from the apis to create a comprehensive package for the user to not only understand our model and the data pipeline but to predict the future!
