    Frontend Idea:
        Create a Django Project that will allow user to input stock price on website and will return our models expected price at several different time frames.

    Why Django?
        Since Django is already in Python I believe it will be the easiest way to integrate our model

    Development Plan
        1. Create File that Combines our EarningsReportJunkie and StockPrediction_Transformers_SA_CNN machine learning models into an compact file that our website will run
        2. Create a Text Field and Submit button that will run our machine learning file on the stock indicated in the textfield
        3. Aggregate Predicted Prices into a List and then export to frontend for user to see
